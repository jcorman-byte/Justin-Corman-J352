    <h1>NBA Offense at a Glance: Early-Season Leaders</h1>
    <h2>
      Using ESPN data to highlight which players are driving their teams’ scoring and playmaking from October 21st to
      November 21st.
    </h2>

    <p>
      The first month of the NBA season always brings breakout performances and eye-popping box scores. To see who is
      really carrying their team on offense, this project looks at early-season leaders in both points per game and
      assists per game.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using game-by-game statistics from ESPN.com for contests played between October 21st and November 21st, I pulled
      the top 10 scorers and top 10 passers in the league. The charts below show how tightly packed the race is at the
      top and which stars show up on both lists.
    </p>

    <!-- ===== CHART 1 BLOCK ===== -->
    <section class="chart-block">
      <div class="chart-title">Chart 1: NBA Points Per Game Leaders title</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">
        Luka Doncic leads all scorers at 34.6 points per game, with Tyrese Maxey and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander close
        behind as part of a group of stars hovering around the 30-point mark.

    <p>
      The difference between first and tenth is just over seven points per game, which shows how many players are close
      to scoring 30 a night. Doncic sets the pace, but Maxey, Gilgeous-Alexander, Antetokounmpo and others are close
      enough that one hot week could shuffle the rankings.

    <!-- ===== CHART 2 BLOCK ===== -->
    <section class="chart-block">
      <div class="chart-title">Chart 2: NBA Assists Per Game Leaders</div>
      <div class="chart-deck">
        Nikola Jokić tops the league at 11.1 assists per game, with Cade Cunningham and Josh Giddey anchoring a group of
        primary playmakers who create shots for everyone else.

    <p>
      Unlike the scoring chart, the assists leaderboard is dominated by primary ball-handlers and playmaking bigs. Jokić
      separates himself as a center who runs Denver’s entire offense, while guards like Cunningham and Giddey show how
      much responsibility young creators carry for their teams.
